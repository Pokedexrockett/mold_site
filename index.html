                Did you know that cannabis can grow mold? Unfortunately, a lot of people don't and are therefore unknowingly consuming contaminated bud. A lot of people haven't even seen what moldy weed looks like. Well, that is what I hope to change here. I'm going to present you with the facts of why/how mold spreads on cannabis, how to spot it, and ways to prevent it from happening in the first place.
